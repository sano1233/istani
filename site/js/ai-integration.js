1. **Your goal**: Build muscle, lose fat, increase strength, or improve athletic performance?
2. **Experience level**: Beginner, intermediate, or advanced?
3. **Training frequency**: How many days per week can you train?
4. **Available equipment**: Full gym, home gym, or bodyweight only?

Once you share these details, I'll design a science-backed program using progressive overload principles and optimal training volume (10-20 sets per muscle group per week).`;

**Protein**: Aim for 1.6-2.2g per kg of bodyweight daily, distributed across 4-6 meals (0.4-0.55g/kg per meal) to maximize muscle protein synthesis.

**Nutrient Timing**: Consume protein + carbs within 2 hours post-workout. Pre-workout nutrition isn't critical if you've eaten in the past 3-4 hours.

**Caloric Balance**: For fat loss, maintain a 300-500 calorie deficit. For muscle gain, aim for a 200-300 calorie surplus. Track progress weekly and adjust.

Would you like me to help calculate your specific macros based on your goals and stats?`;

**1. Volume**: Increase weekly sets by 10-20% if you're under 20 sets per muscle group
**2. Intensity**: Incorporate heavy (85-90% 1RM) and light (60-70% 1RM) training phases
**3. Exercise Variation**: Change exercises every 4-6 weeks to provide novel stimulus
**4. Deload**: Take a deload week (50% volume) every 4-6 weeks to super-compensate

Research shows varied training increases strength gains by 2-3% compared to monotonous programming. Which of these areas do you think might be limiting your progress?`;

**Bench Press**: Retract scapula, arch lower back slightly, feet flat on ground. Bar path should be diagonal (over shoulders at top, mid-chest at bottom). Elbows at 45-degree angle.

**Squat**: Hip-width stance, toes slightly out. Break at hips and knees simultaneously. Keep chest up, knees tracking over toes. Depth: hip crease below knee.

**Deadlift**: Bar over mid-foot, shoulders over bar. Engage lats (protect back), brace core. Drive through floor with legs, finish with hip extension (not lower back hyperextension).

For personalized form analysis, consider recording a video of your lift. I can provide specific corrections based on your movement patterns.`;

**Sleep**: 7-9 hours nightly. Muscle protein synthesis peaks 24-48 hours post-training during sleep. Growth hormone release is maximized in deep sleep stages.

**Active Recovery**: Light cardio (20-30 min at 50-60% max HR) increases blood flow and reduces DOMS by 30-40%.

**Nutrition**: Post-workout protein (20-40g) within 2 hours. Omega-3s (2-3g EPA/DHA daily) reduce inflammation.

**Rest Days**: Take 1-2 full rest days weekly. Muscle growth occurs during recovery, not training. Overtraining increases cortisol and inhibits gains.

How's your current sleep and recovery routine? That might be the key to unlocking better progress!`;

    // Cardio questions

**For Fat Loss**:
- HIIT: 15-20 min, 2-3x/week (30s work, 90s rest intervals)
- LISS: 30-45 min, 3-4x/week (60-70% max HR)
- Timing: Post-workout or separate from lifting (6+ hours apart)

**For Muscle Gain**:
- Minimal HIIT (interference effect reduces hypertrophy by 10-15%)
- LISS: 20-30 min, 2-3x/week for cardiovascular health
- Keep cardio volume low to preserve calories for recovery

Research shows cardio + resistance training yields best body composition results, but excessive cardio can impair muscle growth. What's your primary goal, and I'll optimize your cardio protocol?`;

**Tier 1 (Proven Effective)**:
- **Creatine Monohydrate**: 5g daily. Increases strength 5-15%, muscle mass 1-2kg. Most researched supplement.
- **Protein Powder**: Convenient way to hit protein targets. Whey isolate for fast absorption, casein for slow.
- **Caffeine**: 3-6mg/kg bodyweight pre-workout. Improves performance 3-5%.

**Tier 2 (Good Evidence)**:
- **Vitamin D**: 2000-5000 IU daily if deficient. Supports testosterone and immune function.
- **Omega-3s**: 2-3g EPA/DHA daily. Reduces inflammation, supports joint health.
- **Beta-Alanine**: 3-6g daily. Buffers lactic acid, improves high-rep performance.

Save your money on proprietary blends and "fat burners." Creatine + adequate protein covers 90% of supplementation benefits!`;
