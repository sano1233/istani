## 🚀 How to Deploy & Trigger Everything

### Step 1: Create Pull Request to Main

Since `gh` CLI is not available, create PR manually:

**Option A: Via GitHub Web UI**
1. Go to: https://github.com/sano1233/istani/compare
2. Set base branch: `main`
3. Set compare branch: `claude/autonomous-ai-agent-dev-011CUKHkXdpzvf477NG3Vuz9`
4. Click "Create Pull Request"
5. Title: `🚀 Ultra-Secured Autonomous AI Agent System + 100% Functionality`
6. Copy description from: `PR_DESCRIPTION.md`
7. Click "Create Pull Request"

**Option B: Using Git + GitHub API (if you have token)**
```bash
# If you have a GitHub personal access token
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/sano1233/istani/pulls \
  -d '{
    "title": "🚀 Ultra-Secured Autonomous AI Agent System + 100% Functionality",
    "head": "claude/autonomous-ai-agent-dev-011CUKHkXdpzvf477NG3Vuz9",
    "base": "main",
    "body": "See PR_DESCRIPTION.md for full details"
  }'
```
